# Tin

This is the source code for the Tin Framework.

Tin is a Swift Framework for general media arts programming, with an aim for simplicity and ease of use. This project grew out of my desire to use Swift for teaching, and was strongly influenced by my experiences with Processing. (https://processing.org)

A project website is in development at [https://lnolson.github.io/Tin/](https://lnolson.github.io/Tin/).

See example projects in the examples folder.

- Attraction. Lots of rectangles moving around based on a simple gravitational attraction model. This is based on a example in "Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman.
- CartDemo. Simple hierarchical motion demo. A cart, that has two wheels. When the cart moves, the wheels correctly move and rotate. Drag the mouse to move the cart.
- RandomCircles. Draws random circles. This example demos restoring the previous frame to build a continuous drawing.
- SimpleDrawing. Excercises various drawing primitives. Including text and images. Loads and draws a jpg and png image.
- Sway. Uses Perlin noise to draw swaying branches.
- ImageDemo. Load an image and extract colors from random locations.
